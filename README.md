Temperature-sensitive RGB Lights for PC
## Overview
Uses the TI MSP430F5529 (or MSP430G2553 with a USB-serial adapter) to control a WS28128B LED strip. This is intended for use with a Powershell script that sends over max temperature data using OpenHardwareMonitor to provide different animations based on the computer's current temperature.
